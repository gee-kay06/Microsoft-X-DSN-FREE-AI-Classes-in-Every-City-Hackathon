# Microsoft-X-DSN-FREE-AI-Classes-in-Every-City-Hackathon
#### Expresso is an African telecommunications company that provides customers with airtime and mobile data bundles. The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of each Expresso customer “churning,” i.e. becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days.
#### This solution will help Expresso to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are at risk of leaving.
## The code should be ran in the order it appears
## Setup Instructions
#### 1. Clone the repository: 
#### https://github.com/gee-kay06/Microsoft-X-DSN-FREE-AI-Classes-in-Every-City-Hackathon.git
#### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
#### 3. Set up the environment:
#### conda env create -f environment.yml
## Environment
#### Python Version: 3.8+
#### Packages: See environment.yml for a full list of dependencies.
## Feature Explanation
#### TENURE: Length of time the customer has been with Expresso.
#### REVENUE: Monthly income of each customer.
#### DATA_VOLUME: Number of connections by the customer.
#### FREQUENCE: Frequency of transactions or interactions.
#### TOP_PACK: Preferred package by the customer.
#### REGION: Location of each client
#### MONTANT: Top-up amount
#### FREQUENCE_RECH: Number of times the customer refilled
#### ARPU_SEGMENT: Income over 90 days divided by 3
#### ON-NET: Inter expresso call
#### ORANGE: Calls to Orange
#### ZONE1: Calls to zones1
#### ZONE2: Calls to zone2
#### MRG: A client who is going
#### REGULARITY: A number of times the client is active for 90 days
#### FREQ_TOP_PACK: Number of times the client has activated the preferred package
#### CHURN: The probability a customer will churn

## Hardware Requirements
